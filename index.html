Abstract.
/
Through this project, we explore the ways in which we aestheticize and naturalize surveillance, 
whether through an embrace of storytelling and narratives shaped by public policy, 
or participation in a clout-based social media network/zeitgeist.
/
The year is 2025. Alarmed by the adverse effects of excessive noise and sound pollution on 
the populace’s hearing, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issues earplug mandates 
across major cities. While these measures are initially embraced in earnest, various efforts 
to question, or build upon, government-issued earplugs emerge. Some groups, critiquing the 
sterile, bureaucratic overtones of the issued wearables, opt to disassemble the earplugs and 
customize them to their personal taste. Others, concerned about the ubiquity of the wearables, 
devise clandestine ways of gathering without government oversight.
/
By illustrating the range of “trickle-down” effects of sweeping legislation, we aim to sketch 
the complicated network of effects and trends that forms as people interpret legislation. 
A loose reflection on COVID-19 policy, which has effectively vanished in an effort to establish 
some semblance of “a new normal,” the project also seeks to provoke questions about the ways 
public health is framed in contemporary society.
